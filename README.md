# Title : Climb Race Automation

Description: This Python script utilizes computer vision with OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures for controlling a racing game. It detects hand movements to trigger acceleration or braking actions based on finger positions. The script simulates keyboard input to control the game, allowing players to accelerate or brake by gesturing with their hands. Additionally, it features logic to ensure smooth gameplay by handling key presses and releases appropriately.
